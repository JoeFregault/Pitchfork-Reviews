# Pitchfork Reviews Statistical Analysis
## Descriptive Analysis
In "Pitchfork Reviews Analysis.ipynb" you will find a Jupyter Notebook analyzing various trends in the music industry.

Some graphs include:
* Barcharts illustrating mean scores of genres over time
* Individual breakdowns of an artist's album scores throughout their career

My graphs were implemented into a larger descriptive analysis that I co-wrote and designed the thumbnail for. It can be found here: https://ucladatares.medium.com/visualizing-trends-and-patterns-in-pitchfork-reviews-cad1a130869b

## Predictive Analysis (In Progress)
In the "Predicting Pitchfork Reviews.rmd" R Markdown file, I implement some models to predict how the rating of an album based on the words used in the review.
Main predictive methods:
* Classic Neural Networks
* Support Vector Machines

Since the most recent review in the dataset was in December 2017, I inputted new articles to see how accurate the models performed.
