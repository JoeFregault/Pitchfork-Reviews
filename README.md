# Pitchfork Reviews Statistical Analysis
## Descriptive Analysis
In "Pitchfork Reviews Analysis.ipynb" you will find a Jupyter Notebook analyzing various trends in the music industry.

Some graphs include:
* Barcharts illustrating mean scores of genres over time
* Individual breakdowns of an artist's album scores throughout their career
## Predictive Analysis
In the "Predicting Pitchfork Reviews.rmd" R Markdown file, I implement some models to predict how the rating of an album based on the words used in the review.
Main predictive methods:
* Classic Neural Networks
* Support Vector Machines
Since the most recent review in the dataset was in December 2017, I inputted new articles to see how accurate the models performed.
